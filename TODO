[NEW FEATURES]

- Add new IA infrastructure supporting the creation of data models (automatic discovery of data structure from raw data)
- Enhance current post-analysis tooling and add new features supporting investigation (diagrams, statistics, research by pattern, etc.)
- Add GDB/PIN/QEMU probes/managers
- Add bpftrace monitoring subsystem (probes, ...)

[ENHANCEMENT]

- Complete Recursive Node implementation
  - Absorption implementation

- Enhance ModelWalking exploration when the structure of a child node changed because of
  a change in an ancestor node value.

  Exploration by tWALK with @walk_within_recursive_node set to True make basically recursive nodes
  handled as non-terminal nodes. This solves the exploration problem when @consider_sibbling_change
  is also set to True.

- Add full support of String(alphabet=...) in CSP Z3
- Add support for absorption of nodes whose existence has not been resolved yet.
  (Counter-part of the generation supported feature.)
- Clean up test/test_integration.py
